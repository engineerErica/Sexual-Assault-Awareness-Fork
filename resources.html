            <p>In a fight or flight situation, it's important to prioritize your safety and take action to defend yourself against any potential danger, especially in cases of sexual assault. Being proactive and prepared can make all the difference in such situations. Remember that there is no shame in defending yourself and that it's always better to err on the side of caution. If you feel uncomfortable or threatened, don't hesitate to create distance or leave the situation altogether. Being aware of your surroundings and having a plan in place can also help you to react quickly and effectively. </p>
